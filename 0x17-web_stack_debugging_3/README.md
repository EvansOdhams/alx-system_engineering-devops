# Web Stack Debugging Project
## Project Overview
This project involves debugging and fixing a 500 Internal Server Error issue in a WordPress website running on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack. The goal is to use strace to identify the problem, fix it, and then automate the fix using Puppet.
