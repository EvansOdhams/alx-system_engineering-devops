# Postmortem Project

This is a project for DevOps and SysAdmin professionals to practice writing postmortems for system outages or incidents. The project aims to provide experience in handling and documenting critical incidents, understanding root causes, and implementing corrective and preventative measures.

## Overview

The Postmortem Project will help you develop essential skills in analyzing and documenting outages or incidents. You will create a postmortem report that summarizes an outage scenario, covering the duration of the incident, its impact, root cause analysis, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Project Details

## Tasks

1. **My First Postmortem:**
   - Write a postmortem for a web stack outage, whether real or fictional.
