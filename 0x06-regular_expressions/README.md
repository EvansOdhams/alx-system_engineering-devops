# Regular Expressions
This repository contains the solutions and examples for the "Regular Expressions" project. The project focuses on using regular expressions in Ruby, specifically the Oniguruma library, to perform pattern matching and text manipulation.

## Description
Regular expressions are powerful tools for working with textual data. They allow you to define patterns and search for specific sequences of characters within a string. This project explores the basics and advanced concepts of regular expressions, including metacharacters, quantifiers, character classes, capturing groups, and more.

The main script, example.rb, demonstrates the usage of regular expressions in extracting patterns from command-line arguments. It utilizes the scan method to search for specific patterns and then joins the matched patterns to form a result.

## Files
example.rb: The main Ruby script that uses regular expressions to extract patterns from command-line arguments.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and documentation for the project.

## Usage
- To run the example.rb script, execute the following command in the terminal:

- ./example.rb <input_string>
- Replace <input_string> with the desired string on which you want to apply the regular expression pattern. The script will extract the matching patterns and print the result.

## Resources

- Rubular: An online regular expression testing tool.
- Use a regular expression against a problem: now you have 2 problems
- Learn Regular Expressions with simple, interactive exercises

## Requirements
The scripts are intended to be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
You may use any text editor of your choice, such as vi, vim, or emacs.
All scripts should end with a new line.
Make sure the scripts are executable using the command chmod +x <filename>.
Feel free to explore the provided scripts and modify them according to your requirements. Regular expressions can be a valuable skill in various areas of programming and data manipulation. Happy coding!
