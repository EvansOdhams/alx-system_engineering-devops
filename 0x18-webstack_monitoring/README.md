# Webstack Monitoring Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement web stack monitoring for servers. The monitoring includes two main categories: application monitoring to ensure running software behaves as expected and server monitoring to prevent server overloads, such as CPU, memory, disk, or network overload.

## Background

“You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing. This project focuses on web stack monitoring, which is essential for maintaining the health and performance of web servers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to understand the following key concepts:
- Why monitoring is needed in the tech industry.
- The two main areas of monitoring: Application Monitoring and Server Monitoring.
- The role of access logs for a web server, such as Nginx.
- The role of error logs for a web server, such as Nginx.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- All Bash script files must be executable.
- Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without any errors.
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose.

### Your Servers

- Server 1: 263063-web-01, Username: ubuntu, IP: 100.25.154.163 (running).
- Server 2: 263063-web-02, Username: ubuntu, IP: 54.234.97.151 (running).
- Server 3: 263063-lb-01, Username: ubuntu, IP: 54.157.191.245 (running).

## Project Structure

- Your project should include the necessary Bash scripts for setting up web stack monitoring.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.

## Usage

- Provide clear instructions on how to run your monitoring scripts and what they accomplish.

## Concepts

You should have a good understanding of the following concepts:
- Monitoring
- Server

## Resources

It is recommended to review the following resources for better understanding:
- [What is server monitoring](#)
- [What is application monitoring](#)
- [System monitoring by Google](#)
- [Nginx logging and monitoring](#)

## Copyright and Plagiarism

Avoid plagiarism. You must come up with solutions for the tasks independently to meet the learning objectives. Do not publish the content of this project.
