## Introduction

This project focuses on understanding and implementing firewall rules on servers. Firewalls are crucial for network security as they control incoming and outgoing network traffic, ensuring that only authorized connections are allowed while blocking or rejecting unwanted traffic.

---

## Background

Firewalls are an essential component of server and network security. They act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, helping to protect servers and data from potential threats.

In this project, you will learn about the importance of firewalls, how to configure them, and how to test them using tools like `telnet` to ensure that the desired ports are open and accessible.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, make sure you have a good understanding of the following concepts:

- Web stack debugging
- Basics of networking and ports

---

## Instructions

1. Begin by reading the provided resources and understanding the importance of firewalls.
2. Explore the concept of "Web stack debugging" to gain insights into debugging tools like `telnet`.
3. Practice using `telnet` to check if specific ports are open on a server. This skill is valuable for debugging and ensuring proper network communication.
4. Note that the project mentions a school network firewall that filters outgoing connections. To test your work on a server like `web-01`, perform tests from outside the school network, e.g., from your `web-02` server.
5. Be cautious when working with firewall rules. Mishandling them can lead to unintended consequences, such as losing SSH access to your server. Ensure that you understand and manage the rules carefully.

**Warning:** Containers on demand cannot be used for this project due to Docker container limitations.
